# GroupPlugin

Formerly alliance plugin, to see alliance code look in the archive branch 

Point the config to a network folder to share it between servers that sync faction data 

Groups is the basic group system from alliances, but with all the events distributed across cluster using nexus API, and compilable scripts for new commands/logics/patches
